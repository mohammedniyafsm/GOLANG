# 🧵 Goroutines in Go

## 📌 What is a Goroutine?

A **goroutine** is a lightweight thread managed by the **Go runtime**.

> Goroutines allow Go programs to run multiple functions **concurrently**.

They are:
- Very cheap to create
- Faster than OS threads
- Managed by Go scheduler

## 🧠 Why Goroutines?

Without goroutines, programs run **sequentially**:

```bash
Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3
